TODO:

1.) Everything is this (BK.Plugins.PInvoke) is internal
this makes sense as the plugin which references this assembly should hide all that pinvoke stuff
this means that the user can only access the components which the parent assembly is designed for
but on the other hand it makes sense to publish this assembly as standalone
to solve this issue we have to:
a.) use the opposite of internalsvisibleto by using pre processor conditions
b.) add a build configuration which enables the accessability of the plugin
=> this means we can change the accessability of components at compile time
